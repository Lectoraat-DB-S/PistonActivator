This is some simple code for the Arduino Opta. The Arduino accepts a signal as an input and delays it for 2 seconds before activating the piston. The system can handle multiple signals from the sensor within 2 seconds.

For the project the following hardware has been used:
  - Arduino Opta WIFI
  - Optic Sensor
  - 24V power supply
  - Piston
  - pneumatic valve
